Instructions
********************************

There are three basic steps to running the benchmark:

	1. Generate test inputs
	2. Calculate the sum from those inputs to use as a comparison later
	3. Run the suite of timings

********************************

1. Generate test inputs

	Run 'make' to build the gen_file and calc_sum utilities.
	Run 'gen_file numbers.dat n' to generate a stream of numbers.
		NOTE: n is the exponent such that N = 2**n numbers are generated

2. Calculate the sum from those inputs to use as a comparison later

	Run 'calc_sum output.dat alpha' where alpha is the constant in the SAXPY operation
		NOTE: Currently, this is hard-coded as '3.0' in the tests, so use that value here
	
3. Run the suite of timings	
	
	You can edit the 'time.pl' file to change compilers and switches.
	
	To run the timings test, use 'perl time.pl --timings numbers.dat cmp_sum output.csv'
	where 'cmp_sum' is the output from running 'calc_sum'.
	
	If you would like to inspect the object code generated for any given test, then you
	can use 'perl time.pl test compiler arch_index opt_index'. See 'time.pl' for details.
	The output will be saved to '__temp__'.
